# Resume_study_non_verbal_analysis
Studied vocal and head post differences between deceivers and truth tellers in a mock recruiter review session. Findings contribute to deception detection research.


The analysis found that head position variance is not affected by role or the interaction between role and stage. However, there was a significant effect of the "role" factor on spectral features. The Truth-teller group showed higher variance of spectral change compared to the Deceiver group, indicating differences in vocal characteristics.
